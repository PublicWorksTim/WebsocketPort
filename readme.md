This is a NodeJS webscocket with webworker prototype. I converted my previous project to the latest NodeJS release.
My future plans are to implement websocketstreams so that I don't have to solve the backpressure issue in an annoying way.
I'm also working on a classes that make it easier to automatically implement a protocol for bytecode data exchaning between the client and server.
